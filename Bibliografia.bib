The monoclinic structure of rhabdophane was reﬁned by the Rietveld method within the C2 (5) space group. The nanopowders were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron microdiffraction (selected area electron diffraction, SAED), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), thermal analysis, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements for analysis of surface area and porosity (ASAP) and pycnometric density measurements. These methods showed the formation of rod-like single-crystal rhabdophane nanoparticles with isolated pores inside the nanoparticles. To describe the formation of such nanoparticles, a mechanism of coherent-accommodative intergrowth of nanoscale clusters with rhabdophane structure is proposed.},

  abstract   = {The luminescent intensity of rare earth-doped lanthanide orthophosphates (LnPO4:Re3+) vary, depending on morphology and crystal structure. In this context, terbium-doped yttrium orthophosphate (YPO4:Tb3+) nanoparticles with different morphologies and crystalline structures were successfully obtained by hydrothermal process. The morphology and crystal structure were modiﬁed by varying the pH, temperature and dopant concentration. The YPO4:Tb3+ nanocrystals were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM and photoluminescence. X-ray patterns show that monoclinic, hexagonal and tetragonal phases of YPO4 depend on the pH and temperature of synthesis; besides synthesis conditions, the hexagonal structure is inﬂuenced by the terbium concentration. The monoclinic phase is transformed into the tetragonal phase at synthesis temperatures higher than 100 C. Both structures, monoclinic and hexagonal, change to the tetragonal phase when subjected to heat treatment. According to SEM images, the morphology depends on the crystal structure. Finally, the photoluminescent properties of YPO4:Tb3+ with different crystal structures were investigated and compared.},

This transition is not associated with as change in the crystallite size because nanocrystals of the anhydrous lanthanum orthophosphate phase with monazite structure retain a size of about 10 nm both at the instant of the structural transformation and up to temperatures of 600–700°C. The technological modes were determined in which nanocrystalline lanthanum orthophosphate powders with monazite structure can be obtained and the powders are used for sintering of ceramic materials with porosity on the level of 5–7\%.},

  abstract  = {Several materials have or are currently being investigated for nuclear waste sequestration applications, including crystalline ceramic oxides, glasses, and glass−ceramic composites. Rare-earth phosphates have been investigated extensively for this application owing to the range of structures that the hydrous or anhydrous versions can adopt as well as the fact that naturally occurring rare-earth phosphates have been found to contain U or Th. The purpose of this mini-review is to discuss (generally) the properties that must be considered when identifying nuclear wasteform materials and (more specifically) the structure and properties of rare-earth phosphates with special attention being given to the resistance of these materials to radiation-induced structure damage. The last section of the mini-review contains an introduction to the development of glass−ceramic composite materials that contain rare-earth phosphate crystallites dispersed in a glass matrix. These composite materials have been suggested to be superior to using just glass or ceramic materials for nuclear waste sequestration applications owing to improved waste loading capabilities.},

The materials were synthesized at low temperatures (4 C) using a precipitation method and the long-range and local structures were determined using powder XRD and XANES. The churchite materials crystallize in the monoclinic system (Space group – C2/c) and adopt a 2D layered structure with water occupying the interlayer regions. The churchite materials were found to transform to the xenotime structure at 300 C. DC magnetization experiments reveal the absence of long-range magnetic ordering between 300 and 1.8 K. The effective magnetic moments (μeff) are similar to those of the free RE (RE ¼ Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) ions.},

  abstract = {Rare earth phosphates comprise a large family of compounds proposed as possible nuclear waste disposal forms. We report structural and thermodynamic properties of a series of rare earth rhabdophanes and monazites. The water content of the rhabdophanes, including both adsorbed and structural water, decreases linearly with increase in ionic radius of the rare earth. The energetics of the transformation of rhabdophane to monazite plus water and the enthalpy of formation of rhabdophane from the constituent oxides was determined by high temperature drop solution calorimetry. The former varies linearly with the ionic radius of the lanthanide, except for cerium. By combining the enthalpy of formation determined by high temperature drop solution calorimetry and the free energy of formation determined previously by solubility experiments, a complete set of thermodynamic data was derived for the rhabdophanes. They are thermodynamically metastable with respect to the corresponding monazites plus water at all temperatures under ambient pressure conditions. This conclusion strengthens the case for monazites being an excellent nuclear waste form.},
